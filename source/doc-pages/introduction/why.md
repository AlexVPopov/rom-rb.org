If you care about clarity, explicitness and structured approach to handling data
and persistence you probably want to give ROM a try. With ROM you design your
domain layer like you want, it's not coupled to the structure of your database.
It also makes it easy to work with different datasources by giving you a minimum
infrastructure to support it. It avoids high-level abstractions that are great
in the beginning and a horror later on. Its adapters are based on battle-tested
and powerful libraries like `Sequel` giving you a very stable foundation. It can
be easily integrated with full-stack frameworks like Rails or used "standalone"
in other use cases. Oh, it's fast too and highly optimizable.
