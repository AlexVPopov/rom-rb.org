This tutorial explains how to make ROM feel right at home in your Rails application. It is primarily intended for those familiar with Rails who want to learn more about ROM.

To understand how ROM integrates with Rails, we will work through the steps required to build a simple todo list application.

The application will have the following capabilities:

* [Getting started](/tutorials/rails/getting-started) - quickly initialize an application with a ROM-based template
* [Displaying tasks](/tutorials/rails/tasks-index) - understand ROM’s read model by displaying a list of tasks
* [Managing tasks](/tutorials/rails/task-relation) - 
* [Task mapper](/tutorials/rails/task-mapper) - define a dedicated mapper for domain objects
* [Managing tasks](/tutorials/rails/managing-tasks) - implement create/update/delete actions with commands
* [Validations](/tutorials/rails/validations) - use validators
- Displaying the list of tasks
- Filtering and ordering the list of tasks
- Creating new tasks
- Updating, re-prioritizing and completing tasks
- Deleting tasks

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have learned the following:

- How ROM integrates with Rails
- How to use ROM to build basic CRUD applications
- How to test Rails apps that depend on ROM

If that sounds good, then let’s get started!
